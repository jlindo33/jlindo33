### Good morning, good evening, or whatever applies to you!!! ðŸ‘‹  

In 2013, I decided I wanted to make a career change. Being "stuck" in a retail career I decided to pursue higher education at an older age. While working full-time, in 2021 I finally earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. However, finding a developer job has still proven to be difficult. I have worked with Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I am familiar with Flask and Bootstrap. I have worked with RestAPI's and also have familiarity with MySQL and MongoDB. Most recently I have been spending most of my time with Javascript and really enjoying what I'm doing. Also in October 2021 I earned my Professonal Scrum Master I certification from scrum.org.
