### Good morning, good evening, or whatever applies to you!!! ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Joe and I am a recent graduate with 15 years of professional experience looking to make an exciting career change into the development world. Most of my experience thus far has been working with Python, Java, and relational databases (MySql, SQLite).
I am currently learning Django and JavaScript in my free time and some of my interests include mobile development, gaming and sports.
